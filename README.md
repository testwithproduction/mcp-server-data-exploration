## 🚀 Try it Out

### With Claude Desktop

1. **Download Claude Desktop**
   - Get it [here](https://claude.ai/download)

2. **Install and Set Up**
   - On macOS, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   - On Windows, it might be easier to run this with uv under WSL and SSE transport

3. **Load Templates and Tools**
   - Once the server is running, wait for the prompt template and tools to load in Claude Desktop.

4. **Start Exploring**
   - Select the explore-data prompt template from MCP
   - Begin your conversation by providing the required inputs:
     - `csv_path`: Local path to the CSV file
     - `topic`: The topic of exploration (e.g., "Weather patterns in New York" or "Housing prices in California")

### With other AI tools like Cherry Studio

1. Configure MCP per Cherry Studio instruction. Using SSE mode might be the easiest way, just add URL.
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse
```
2. Run this MCP server with SSE transport
3. Enable MCP tool when chatting in Cherry Studio.

#### TODO: figure out how to prompt properly. Currently need to copy the whole prompt_template into Chat, which is not as simple as Claude Desktop.

## 📦 Components

### Transport Options
The server supports multiple transport protocols:

- **stdio** (default): Standard input/output communication, ideal for local development and MCP clients
- **sse**: Server-Sent Events, useful for web-based clients
- **websocket**: WebSocket transport for real-time communication

You can specify the transport using the `--transport` parameter:
```bash
# Use stdio (default)
mcp-server-ds

# Use SSE transport
mcp-server-ds --transport sse

# Use WebSocket transport
mcp-server-ds --transport websocket
```

### Prompts
- **explore-data**: Tailored for data exploration tasks

### Tools
1. **load-csv**
   - Function: Loads a CSV file into a DataFrame
   - Arguments:
     - `csv_path` (string, required): Path to the CSV file
     - `df_name` (string, optional): Name for the DataFrame. Defaults to df_1, df_2, etc., if not provided

2. **run-script**
   - Function: Executes a Python script
   - Arguments:
     - `script` (string, required): The script to execute

## ⚙️ Modifying the Server

### Claude Desktop Configurations
- macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Development (Unpublished Servers)
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "mcp-server-ds": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "--directory",
      "/Users/username/src/mcp-server-ds",
      "run",
      "mcp-server-ds",
      "--transport",
      "stdio"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Published Servers
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "mcp-server-ds": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-server-ds",
      "--transport",
      "stdio"
    ]
  }
}
```
### Use SSE Transport
```json

## About

This is an open source project run by [ReadingPlus.AI LLC](https://readingplus.ai). and open to contributions from the entire community.

## Thoughts

1. Claude is really good at generating proper code, Claude 4 generate ready-to-run code mostly in one shot. OpenAI and Deepseek code quality is so so.
2. Claude desktop has a built in Analyze data feature, which does not rely on this MCP server at all.
